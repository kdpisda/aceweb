								<h2>BTECH EVALUATION</h2>
								<p> There are total eight semesters in a 4-year B.tech (CSE) course,with each year consisting of two semesters.Each semester consists of:<BR>
<B><u>a.)CT's(class test):</u></b>Each semester consists of  two class tests,CT-1 and CT-2        each of 15 marks.<br>
<B><u>b.)TA(Teacher's Assesment):</u></b>Each subject has a TA weightage of 20 marks.Some teachers prefer viva session for the allotment of marks while others prefer attendance and assignment submission as their marks allotment basis.<br>
<B><u>c.)PRACTICAL EXAM:</u></b>Number of practical subjects that a student has to learn ,varies from year to year. Practical exam of each subject has a weightage of  30 marks.Practical exam is conducted once in a semester,after the semester examination.It consists of theory,viva and practical.<br>
<B><u>d.)END SEM EXAM:</u></b>It has a weightage of 70 marks per subject,in which passing marks  are 25 per subject.Again,the number of subjects that a student has to prepare for session ending varies from year to year.It is conducted once in a semester.<br>
